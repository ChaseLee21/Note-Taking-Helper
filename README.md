  ## Description
  This is a project that utilizes an express.js backend to handle get, post, and delete request that allow the user to save and delete notes. This project is apart of the coding bootcamp I took where we were given the front end code and had to create the backend code to make the app work. This project was a great way to learn how to use express.js and how to use it to handle requests.
